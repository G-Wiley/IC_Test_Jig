# IC_Test_Jig
The IC Test Jig is a small accessory to the Flip Chip Tester System that enables testing of individual ICs in the tester. The jig is a short single-width PCB with a ZIF IC socket to hold digital ICs up to 28 pins that are 0.3 to 0.6 inches wide. On-board headers allow VCC and GND to be connected directly to the power pins of the IC being tested.

Special test files having the prefix “JIG” have been created to test SN7400-series ICs that are commonly used in PDP-8/L and PDP-8/I computers.
